🧠 Agentic Marketplace (CLI Demo)
A beginner-friendly agentic AI marketplace simulation showing how autonomous buyer and seller agents interact, negotiate, transact, and explain outcomes — all in a clean terminal dashboard.
🚀 What This Project Does
This project simulates an agent-driven marketplace where:
Buyers submit service requests
Sellers autonomously accept or refuse
Payments can succeed or fail
Every outcome is clearly explained in a readable table
The goal is transparency — not just what happened, but why it happened.

🧩 Why This Matters
Most demos show results only.
This shows decision-making.
Autonomous agents
Negotiation outcomes
Transparent reasoning
Human-readable explanations
That’s real agentic behavior, even in a simple CLI.
🛠 Tech Stack
Python 3
PrettyTable (terminal UI formatting)
CLI-based simulation (no UI distractions)
⚙️ How to Run
1️⃣ Install dependency
Copy code
Bash
python3 -m pip install prettytable
2️⃣ Run the marketplace
Copy code
Bash
python3 marketplace.py
🧠 Agent Logic (Simple & Clear)
✅ Delivered → Payment sufficient, seller accepted
🤖 Refused → Seller agent declined service
❌ Payment Failed → Buyer payment below requirement
Each agent decision is logged and explained inline.
🎯 Use Cases
Hackathon demos
Agentic AI education
CLI dashboard examples
Early-stage marketplace simulations
📌 Why CLI?
This project focuses on logic and clarity, not frontend polish.
A dashboard or web UI can be added later — the agent behavior already works.
