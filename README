Agentic Marketplace – AI + Blockchain
This project simulates an agent-driven marketplace where:
Buyers submit service requests
Sellers autonomously accept or refuse
Payments can succeed or fail
Every outcome is clearly explained in a readable table
The goal is transparency — not just what happened, but why it happened.

🧩 Why This Matters
Most demos show results only. This shows decision-making.
Autonomous agents negotiate and resolve outcomes.
Transparent reasoning — why transactions succeed, fail, or get refused.
Blockchain-ready simulation shows how payments and reputation can exist on-chain.
Human-readable explanations, perfect for hackathons or education.
🛠 Tech Stack
Python 3
PrettyTable (terminal UI formatting)
CLI-based simulation (no UI distractions)
Simulated Sepolia testnet connection (blockchain-ready)
⚙️ How to Run
1️⃣ Install dependencies
Copy code
Bash
python3 -m pip install prettytable
2️⃣ Run the marketplace
Copy code
Bash
python3 marketplace.py
🧠 Agent Logic (Simple & Clear)
✅ Delivered → Payment sufficient, seller accepted
🤖 Refused → Seller agent declined service
❌ Payment Failed → Buyer payment below requirement
Each agent logs decisions with reasoning, now including blockchain readiness.
🎯 Use Cases
Hackathon demos
Agentic AI education
CLI dashboard examples
Early-stage marketplace simulations
📌 Why CLI?
Focuses on logic and clarity, not frontend polish.
Blockchain + AI agent behavior already works, UI can be added later.
